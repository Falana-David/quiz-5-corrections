Q1: From a classification perspective, a getter method is a(n)...?


My Answer: constructor 


Correct Answer: accessor

Why It's Correct: 
Special methods called getters (or, more formally, accessor methods) 
are designed to retrieve the value of an instance variable. 
As the other of a class, we provide access under our terms. 
Accesor methods are needed in order to restrict who can access 
fields and how they can access them.

Q8: From a classification perspective, a setter method is a(n)...?


My Answer: constructor 


Correct Answer: mutator

Why It's Correct:
More formally, setters are called mutator methods because they 
change the state of an object by modifying its underlying data.
As a counterpart to getter methods, setter methods do the opposite. 
They alter the value of a specific instance variable.
